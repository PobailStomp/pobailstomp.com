Pobail Stomp is a community-centric swing dance organisation. We run a weekly swing dance social in Dublin, Ireland, featuring an introductory class followed by two hours of social dancing. We also facilitate progressive classes for uncommon styles of swing dancing such as Balboa and Collegiate Shag.

Swing dancing has its roots in Lindy Hop, an African-American dance. It is a way for people to connect to each other, and we use it to build a sense of community and culture. We do our best to appreciate the history of the dance we are guests to and educate others in turn.

You don’t need any previous experience to try swing dancing, and you don’t need to bring a partner. The class starts at 8PM, and the class includes two hours of social dancing that start afterwards. We encourage everyone to dance with each other: it’s natural to feel shy when starting!
